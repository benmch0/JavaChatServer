This is a simple programme I am making to practice the following components:

1. Java Programming.
2. Threading in programs.
3. GUI Making.
4. Using SQL Databases with Java.

As of now the program will contain the following files:

ChatServer.java --> File containing the original login window and Main function
Login.java --> File with code for login window when logging in and saving credentials.
Register.java --> File with code for register window for creating new users in the DB.
ChatWindow.java --> File that has code for the window where you will be able to chat with other users.
Stats.java --> Potential File for storing user stats, such as amount of chats made etc etc.
